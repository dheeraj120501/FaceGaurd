\metachapter{Abstract}

Real-time face recognition is increasingly recognized as a vital tool for law enforcement, but its practical application is fraught with complexities that threaten its reliability and efficiency. This survey paper delves into the key challenges inhibiting consistent real-time facial recognition in law enforcement scenarios. Foremost among these challenges are occlusions that obscure pivotal facial details, such as face masks or sunglasses. Equally significant is the difficulty of identifying multiple individuals in crowded settings, a frequent occurrence in many law enforcement contexts. Moreover, dynamic and shifting backgrounds present another layer of complexity, often impeding consistent recognition accuracy. In this survey paper, we traverse the landscape of face recognition technology, examining various algorithms, datasets, and techniques employed in recent research endeavours. By consolidating current understanding and highlighting gaps, we aim to provide a foundational reference for future research endeavours seeking to optimize real-time face recognition for law enforcement purposes.
