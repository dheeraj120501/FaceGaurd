\chapter{CONCLUSION}

In this preliminary project report, we discuss this project's core objective, which was to address the persistent challenges of real time face recognition in the wild for law enforcement scenarios. To this end, we designed a real time face recognition system which can detect faces in the wild in real time. The project is not only about enhancing user experiences but also about promoting enhanced public safety. By identifying individuals of interest in real-time, we tend to create a system in which law enforcement can act proactively to prevent crimes or apprehend suspects more efficiently. Swift and accurate identification of individuals can lead to timely interventions, preventing potential security threats and ensuring the safety of the public.
