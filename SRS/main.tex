\chapter{Introduction}
    In the rapidly advancing domain of law enforcement, the emergence of real-time face recognition is a pivotal tool for enhancing security, optimizing response times, and bolstering crime prevention and investigative capabilities. However, the practical deployment of such real-time facial recognition systems is rife with complexities, especially when applied to the dynamic and often unpredictable scenarios encountered in law enforcement. Challenges such as occlusions, dynamic backgrounds, and the inherent intricacies of tracking multiple individuals in crowded settings underscore the need for robust, efficient, and reliable systems. This System Requirement Specification (SRS) document is geared towards detailing the prerequisites, desired functionalities, and specifications for the development of an advanced real-time face recognition system tailored to meet the unique needs and challenges of law enforcement.
    
    \section{Purpose}
    Develop a real-time face recognition system tailored specifically for law enforcement. This system is designed to enhance security measures, facilitate faster responses, and offer more effective crime prevention and investigation by swiftly and accurately identifying individuals in the field. It aims to navigate and address the inherent challenges in real-world law enforcement scenarios, such as facial occlusions due to masks or sunglasses, recognition in crowded settings, and varying backgrounds. The system seeks to optimize the process of face detection, tracking, and recognition, ensuring it meets the unique demands and high stakes of law enforcement scenarios.
    
    \section{Document Conventions}
    Throughout this project, we will follow a set of document conventions to guarantee clarity and uniformity. Standardized file, function, and variable names as well as a predetermined format for recording code, logs, and problem reports are all part of these standards. Respecting these guidelines will make teamwork easier and enable the system to be easily maintained and scaled up.
    
    \section{Intended Audience and Reading Suggestions}
    The target audience for this project consists of Law Enforcement Agencies, including police departments and investigative bodies. It serves security professionals, forensic analysts, legal authorities, academic researchers in computer vision, policymakers, public safety departments, and technology integrators. This system aids in crime prevention, victim identification, surveillance, academic research, and enhanced public safety during events or emergencies. The system's architecture, user manuals, and development guidelines are among the reading recommendations.
    
    \section{Project Scope}
    This project's scope includes creating an real time face recognition system that can match the detected face with a database in real-time, allowing for swift identification. It also consists of a secure and scalable database to store facial data. This database can be updated as required, allowing for additions, modifications, or deletions.    Providing thorough documentation to help users deploy and utilize the system efficiently is another aspect of the scope. The project's scope is set to ensure that the system is not just accurate but also practical for the high-stakes, dynamic environments in which law enforcement operates.

        It operates within a broader system perspective, integrating seamlessly with existing law enforcement surveillance infrastructure. This system serves as a modular component, capable of functioning both independently and as an integral part of the surveillance ecosystem. Its main functions encompass face detection, tracking, real-time recognition, and alert generation. The face recognition system complements the surveillance network by enhancing security and investigative capabilities, and it offers a vital tool that promises to revolutionize law enforcement operations. Its versatility in either standalone operation or integration into existing systems ensures flexibility and adaptability to various law enforcement scenarios, positioning it as a valuable asset in the realm of real-time face recognition for law enforcement purposes.
    
    \section{Product Functions}
        The product, a real-time face recognition system for law enforcement, has several core functions. Some of the functions are:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Face Detection:} The system can scan and identify human faces from various sources such as images, videos, and live surveillance feeds. This function can handle multiple faces simultaneously even in crowded scenes and identify them in varying lighting conditions and angles.
            \item \textbf{Face Tracking:} After detecting faces, the system has the capability to track individual faces across a sequence of frames or video streams. It maintains continuity, even if the face undergoes temporary occlusions, movements, or changes in expression.
            \item \textbf{Real-time Face Recognition:} By comparing detected faces against a database of known individuals, the system can swiftly and accurately identify persons of interest. This function is invaluable in law enforcement settings, where the prompt identification of a suspect or missing person can be crucial.
            \item \textbf{Alert Generation:} When the system identifies a match or encounters a predefined scenario (e.g., an individual from a watchlist appearing in a restricted area), it generates real-time alerts. These notifications can be forwarded to law enforcement officers or other relevant personnel for immediate action.
            \item \textbf{Integration with Existing Surveillance Systems:} The product seamlessly integrates with current surveillance infrastructure, making it a plug-and-play solution that enhances the capabilities of existing systems.

    \section{Performance Requirements}
        An system will efficiently recognize criminals at real time, processing frames at a minimum rate, and making decisions within a reasonable time frame, optimizing performance metrics for various situations.
        \begin{enumerate}

                \begin{itemize}
                    \item \textit{Requirement:} The system must process a minimum of 24 to 30 frames per second (FPS) for smooth recognition.
                    \item \textit{Rationale:} A frame rate of about 24 FPS ensures an acceptable level of visual continuity and responsiveness in most games. It provides a baseline for a positive user experience.
                \end{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Recognition Response Time Requirement:}
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item \textit{Requirement:} The system should make decisions within a maximum of 100 milliseconds after receiving each game frame.
                    \item \textit{Rationale:} A 100ms response time ensures the system reacts promptly to changing game conditions.
                \end{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Resource Utilization Requirement:}
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item \textit{Requirement:} The system must not consume more than 40\% of the available CPU and memory resources on the host machine.
                    \item \textit{Rationale:} Keeping resource usage low ensures the AI agent operates without significantly degrading the performance of the host system, allowing concurrent testing with other applications.
                \end{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Logging Performance Requirement:}
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item \textit{Requirement:} The system must log performance metrics and bug reports without causing a noticeable slowdown and lags, maintaining at least 24 FPS during logging.
                    \item \textit{Rationale:} Logging is critical for post-test analysis, but it should not interfere with real time recognition to provide accurate performance data.
                \end{itemize}
